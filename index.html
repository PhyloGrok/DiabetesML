                In this study, we aim to address the question of whether clinical features such as glucose levels, BMI, pregnancies,
                and etc. can effectively predict diabetes in Pima Indian women. The importance of this work lies in improving the
                early detection of diabetes, a condition that is prevalent and can lead to severe health complications if left
                untreated. Early prediction and diagnosis of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes through timely
                intervention.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                We built a logistic regression model with hyperparameter optimization for C, and evaluated its performance on the
                test set. The final classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.750 on the test set, outperforming the baseline dummy
                classifier's accuracy of 0.672. Glucose was the most significant predictor, followed by BMI and pregnancies,
                while blood pressure and insulin had weaker impacts. Out of a total of 217 test cases, the model correctly
                predicted 162 and misclassified 54. 41 mistakes were predicting patients with diabetes as non-diabetic
                (i.e. false negatives), while 13 mistakes were predicting healthy (non-diabetic) patients with diabetes (i.e.
                false positives).
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                The results indicate that logistic regression is a promising tool for diabetes screening, providing an efficient
                way to identify potential cases. However, the high number of false negatives is concerning, as they could lead to
                delayed diagnoses and treatments. The use of logistic regression itself has some limitations as it assumes
                linear relationships and may not capture complex interactions between features. Future improvements could
                include feature engineering of polynomial features, testing alternative machine learning models, reporting more
                metrics to reflect model performance (i.e. recall and / or f2 score to focus on reducing false negatives), and
                incorporating additional data, such as lifestyle or genetic factors. Moreover, adding probability estimates for
                predictions could also enhance its clinical usability by helping prioritize further diagnostic tests. These steps
                could make the model more reliable and practical for real-world healthcare applications.

                Diabetes is a serious chronic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood, which can result
                from insufficient insulin production or the body’s inability to effectively use insulin. Its prevalence has nearly
                doubled since 1980, with 14% of adults aged 18 and older diagnosed with diabetes in 2022, up from 7% in 1990
                <span class="citation" data-cites="who_diabetes">(World Health Organization n.d.)</span>. The disease can lead to
                severe complications, including blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, strokes, and lower limb amputations.

                This study aims to address the research question: can diabetes in Pima Indian women be accurately predicted

                analysis, the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, contains clinical data for 768 women aged 21 and older, with 8
                input variables: number of pregnancies, plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skinfold
                thickness, serum insulin, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, and age. The output variable is
                whether or not the woman has diabetes, with two classes: positive (1) or negative (0). To this end, the
                objective of this report is to evaluate the predictive performance of logistic regression (LR), a supervised
                machine learning model, in diagnosing diabetes.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                In this study, Logistic Regression was employed to develop a classification model for predicting whether a
                patient has diabetes. The model was trained using all features in the dataset, with the outcome column serving
                as the target variable. The data was split into a 70% training set and a 30% testing set.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Hyperparameter tuning was performed using <code>RandomizedSearchCV</code>, and the accuracy score was used as the
                evaluation metric for model performance. The hyperparameter C of the Logistic Regression model, which
                controls the trade-off between model complexity and training data fitting, was optimized using a log-uniform
                distribution ranging from \(1 \times 10^{-5}\) and \(1 \times 10^{5}\). The range and log-uniform distribution
                was chosen to efficiently explore a wide range of values, balancing model complexity and fitting. This
                approach ensures the model is not overly regularized or overfitted, promoting better generalization to unseen
                data.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Standardization was applied to all input variables just before model fitting to ensure that the features were
                on the same scale. This process was done to improve model performance and to help prevent any single feature
                from dominating the others. The analysis was conducted using the Python programming language
                (Van Rossum and Drake 2009) and several Python packages: numpy (Harris et al. 2020), Pandas (McKinney
                2010), altair (VanderPlas 2018), altair_ally (Ostblom 2021) and scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011). The code

                To assess the potential usefulness of each predictor in forecasting the Outcome variable: 0
                (Non-Diabetic) and 1 (Diabetic), we visualized the distributions of each predictor from the training
                dataset, with the distributions color-coded by class (0: blue, 1: orange) as shown in Figure 1.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                For the <code>Glucose</code> levels, Non-Diabetic class exhibits a roughly normal distribution, whereas the Diabetic
                class shows a pronounced shift toward the middle-to-higher range of glucose levels.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                The <code>BMI</code> distribution resembles a normal distribution but skews slightly toward higher values. Similar
                to Glucose levels, the Diabetic class displays a decent shit towards the middle-to-higher ranges when
                compared to Non-Diabetic class, suggesting the potential for distinct differences between target groups
                within this category.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
                The <code>Age</code> distribution reveals that individuals aged 20 to 32 are predominantly Non-Diabetic. Beyond age
                32, the counts of Diabetic and Non-Diabetic individuals become comparable, with some bins showing a higher
                count for the Diabetic class, despite fewer overall observations in this group. The Non-Diabetic class
                leans toward younger ages, while the Diabetic class has a more even distribution across its age range.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                For <code>Pregnancies</code>, <code>Insulin</code>, and <code>DiabetesPedigreeFunction</code> - genetic risk of diabetes based on
                family history ranging from 0 to 2.5, the lower range of pregnancies is dominated by the Non-Diabetic
                class, whereas whereas higher numbers are more common in the Diabetic class.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                For <code>Blood Pressure</code> and <code>Skin Thickness</code>, both the Diabetic and Non-Diabetic classes approximates a
                normal distribution; however, the Non-Diabetic distribution skews slightly towards lower values, while the
                Diabetic class skews more towards higher values.

                We also examined the presence of multicollinearity among the predictors in Figure 2, as it could be
                problematic when conducting a Logistic Regression. We see that highest level of correlation is between Age
                and Pregnancies (0.626 via Spearman, and 0.566 by Pearson). Since this is below the threshold of 0.7, we
                can conclude that all features’ coefficients are suitable and will not cause any multicollinearity in our
                model.

                Finally, we looked at the pairwise scatterplots between features in Figure 3 to detect any additional
                patterns. For the most part, the features do not display noticeable trends. However, Skin Thickness and BMI
                show a moderate visual relationship, which is intuitive since higher body mass is generally associated with
                increased skin thickness.

            <p>We then used Logistic Regression model for classification. We optimized the hyperparameter C using a random

                    Having determined the best Logistic Regression model for our analysis, we further explore feature
                    importance with coefficients. Based on the Table 1 below, the feature importance coefficients for the
                    logistic regression model predicting diabetes reveal that Glucose (0.724) is the strongest positive
                    influence, followed by BMI (0.389), Pregnancies (0.229), Age (0.194), and DiabetesPedigreeFunction
                    (0.161). The negative influence SkinThickness (-0.007) along with the remaining positive features
                    BloodPressure (0.048) and Insulin (0.002), have weak impacts on the prediction, with their effects

                    We then evaluate the best Logistic Regression model, obtained from the hyperparameter search, on the
                    test set. Our prediction model performed decent on test data, with a final overall accuracy of 0.750. In
                    addition, looking through confusion matrix (Figure 4), there are a total of 54 mistakes. Of which, 41
                    mistakes were predicting diabetic as non-diabetic (false negatives) and 13 mistakes were made
                    predicting diabetic as non-diabetic (false positives). Considering implementation in clinic, there is
                    room for improvement in the algorithm as false negatives are more harmful than false positives, and we
                    should aim to lower false positives even further.

                    In this report, we have used the default 0.5 threshold in Logistic Regression model to predict the patient
                    being diabetic or non-diabetic. To better evaluate model’s performance across all thresholds, we also
                    presented here the Precision Recall curve (Figure 5) and the ROC curve (Figure 6) - assessing the
                    tradeoff between true positive and false positive rates. For both plots, we did not observe an optimal
                    threshold that can achieve high precision, high recall, and low false positive rate all at once.
                    Therefore, further improvements on the Logistic Regression model or alternative models should be
                    contemplated in further research.

                    To improve the model’s clinical utility, we provide a visualization of estimated prediction probabilities
                    (Figure 7) for diabetes predictions. This allows clinicians to assess the model’s confidence in its
                    predictions and decide whether additional diagnostic tests are needed if the probability is not
                    sufficiently high. Visualizing these probabilities alongside prediction accuracy offers a clearer
                    understanding of the model’s performance, highlighting both correct predictions and misdiagnoses,
                    especially false negatives, which are of particular concern in a clinical setting due to their critical
                    consequences.

                While the performance of this model may be valuable as a screening tool in a clinical context, especially
                given its improvements over the baseline, there are several opportunities for further enhancement. One
                potential approach is to closely examine the 54 misclassified observations, comparing them with correctly
                classified examples from both classes. The objective would be to identify which features may be
                contributing to the misclassifications and investigate whether feature engineering could help the model
                improve its predictions on the observations it is currently struggling with. Additionally, we would try
                seeing whether we can get improved predictions using other classifiers. Other classifiers we might try
                are 1) random forest because it automatically allows for feature interaction, 2) k-nearest neighbours
                (k-NN) which usually provides easily interpretable and decent predictions, and 3) support vector classifier
                (SVC) as it allows for non-linear prediction using the rbf kernel. Finally, there runs the possibility that
                the features offered from this dataset alone are not sufficient to predict with high accuracy. In this
                case, conducting additional conversations with data collectors for additional useable information or
                explore additional datasets that can be joined so our set of features can be expanded for more complicated
                analysis might be beneficial.

                At last, we recognize the limitation with this dataset, as it focuses solely on Pima Indian women aged 21 and
                older, which limits its generalizability to other populations. To improve the analysis, it would be valuable
                to combine this data with other datasets representing different age groups, gende
